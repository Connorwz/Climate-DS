1. Replace neural networks in paper to models such as random forest and XGB
2. Visualize true and predicted $g(\sigma)$

1. For random forest: be careful about data/feature ratio used to fit the model; consider output in a vector; look at parameters in R.
2. Would like to see mse/correlation/rank correlation; produce a table to find those having high/low correlation and high/low mse.
